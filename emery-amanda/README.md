# Blog Project (Lab04 templating)

**Author**: Emery Parks and Amanda Moen
**Version**: 4.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We want our app to render articles with consistent formatting so that you can visit the site often, and have the same experience each time.

## Getting Started
We could slack the IP address for our live server app to the user and they could opoen that into their browser and visit our live site that way.

## Architecture
HTML5, jQuery 3+, CSS3, handlebars.js for templating, icomoon, etc.

## Change Log
Included the Handlebars.js CDN and utilized the library to dynamically render the articles using a template.
Updated the 'Article.prototype.toHtml()' method to utilize the Handlebars template.

## Credits and Collaborations
Emery Parks did all of the driving, but Amanda Moen did learn and understand a bit better from Emery's explanations.

- Convert your existing HTML template into a Handlebars template.
*As a developer, I want to utilize modern JavaScript features so that my code is up to date with industry standards.*

- Refactor the functions and methods in your code to use ES6 arrow functions when possible.
